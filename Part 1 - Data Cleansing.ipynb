    "The United States Census Bureau leads the countryâ€™s Federal Statistical System; its primary\n",
    "responsibility is to collect demographic and economic data about America to help inform\n",
    "strategic initiatives. Every ten years, the census is conducted to collect and organize information\n",
    "regarding the US population with the intention of effectively allocating billions of dollars of\n",
    "funding to various endeavors (e.g., the building and maintenance of hospitals, schools, fire\n",
    "departments, transportation infrastructure, etc.). Additionally, the collection of census\n",
    "information helps to examine the demographic characteristics of subpopulations across the\n",
    "country.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Data\n",
    "You have been provided a sample dataset from the US Census archive containing detailed, but\n",
    "anonymized, information for ~300,000 individuals. This archive contains four files:\n",
    "1. `census_income_learn.csv`\n",
    "2. `census_income_test.csv`\n",
    "3. `census_income_metadata.txt`\n",
    "4. `census_income_additional_info.pdf (supplemental information)`\n",

    "## The Task\n",
    "For this technical assessment, you have been tasked with identifying **characteristics that are\n",

    "As the data scientist on this project, you are to attempt to answer this question by constructing a\n",
    "data analysis/modeling pipeline. Code submissions should be in Python and making the solution\n",
    "easily readable and replicable by the team will give you additional marks. In the event you would\n",
    "like to use a different language or tool, please ask. Considerations for your data analysis should\n",
    "include, but are not limited to, the following:\n",
    "- **Data Preparation: Data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, etc., that may aid\n",
    "in improving data clarity & model generation.**\n",
    "- Exploratory Data Analysis: Numerical and/or graphical representations of the data that\n",
    "may help inform insights and/or tactics for answering the research question of interest.\n",
    "- Data Modeling: The building of a few competing models to predict the target variable.\n",
    "- Model Assessment: A selection of the best model based on performance comparisons.\n",
    "- Results: A concise summary of key findings, recommendations, & future improvements."
